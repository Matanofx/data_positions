In this project I was working on a job postings dataset.
Although there are graphs that represent trends over time such as salary increase or skills changes, the main mission for this project is the dashboard and not the story-telling.
The dashboards are interactive with the slicers in the original report.
Unfortnately Microsoft demands a subscription to share it as is, feel free to review the PDF export.
